# **NOTE**
This GMManager is still in WIP, and you can be in the official app! (or in github), just make an addition in the .py and make a fork, and i'll make sure to add the addition to the official app (or plugin)
There may be bugs, if you find any, report them to the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/ElBFCambiaformas/GModManager/issues)

# Release date?
As of right now, the official app ins't done, there are far many features to be added, so that's why this is open source, i want this app to be *creative*, *easy to use*, and *customizable*
